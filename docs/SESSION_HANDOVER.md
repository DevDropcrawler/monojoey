# MonoJoey Session Handover

This file must be updated at the end of every coding chunk.

## Current Status

- Phase: 3
- Chunk: 3.2 auction bidding and timer state transitions
- Completion status: Chunk 3.2 complete; deterministic bid placement validation, active bid countdown transitions, highest-bid tracking, and bid history are implemented.
- Branch: `main` tracking `origin/main`; local has this chunk committed after final validation.
- Previous commit: `8553048` - `phase-3-1: add auction foundation`
- Commit: `phase-3-2: add auction bidding transitions`
- Date/time: 2026-04-26 23:56 +12:00

## Last Completed Chunk

Phase 3, Chunk 3.2 - auction bidding and timer state transitions only.

Completed:

- Added `AuctionBidResult` and `AuctionBidResultKind` for accepted and rejected bid outcomes.
- Added `AuctionManager.PlaceBid` as a pure deterministic state transition method.
- Added bidder eligibility rejection for bidders not in the game and eliminated players.
- Added first-bid validation against `AuctionState.StartingBid`.
- Added later-bid validation against current highest bid plus `AuctionState.MinimumBidIncrement`.
- Added `AuctionStatus.ActiveBidCountdown`.
- Added `AuctionState.HighestBid`, `AuctionState.HighestBidderId`, and `AuctionState.CountdownDurationSeconds`.
- Made the first valid bid switch from `AwaitingInitialBid` to `ActiveBidCountdown`.
- Made every valid bid reset countdown duration metadata to `BidResetSeconds`.
- Preserved bid history using caller-supplied deterministic bid timestamps.
- Added focused tests for valid first bid, below-starting-bid rejection, below-increment rejection, later bid updates, countdown reset, missing bidder rejection, eliminated bidder rejection, and bid history.

Not included by explicit user scope:

- Real wall-clock timers.
- Async countdown loop.
- Winner finalization.
- Property transfer/payment.
- Loan Shark.
- Networking.
- Unity/UI.
- Persistence.
- Stats.

## Validation Commands Run

- `dotnet build .\server-dotnet\MonoJoey.sln -m:1`
  - Result: succeeded.
  - Output summary: build succeeded, 2 warnings, 0 errors.
  - Warnings: `NU1900` vulnerability-data lookup could not reach `https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json`.
- `dotnet test .\server-dotnet\MonoJoey.sln -m:1`
  - Result: succeeded.
  - Output summary: 65 tests passed.
  - Warnings: same `NU1900` vulnerability-data lookup warning.
- `git status --short --branch`
  - Run after build/test as requested.
  - Output showed `main...origin/main` with modified auction manager/state/status/tests and new `AuctionBidResult.cs`.

## Known Issues

- Plain `dotnet build .\server-dotnet\MonoJoey.sln` and plain `dotnet test .\server-dotnet\MonoJoey.sln` can fail in this Windows shell with no MSBuild errors once the server project participates in the solution graph.
- Serialized validation with `-m:1` succeeds and should be used unless the build harness is revisited.
- `NU1900` warnings remain because NuGet vulnerability metadata lookup cannot reach `https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json`.
- `AGENTS.md` and `LEAN-CTX.md` were not present at the repo root in this sandbox view, though instructions referenced them.

## Placeholders Introduced Or Preserved

- `AuctionConfig.InitialPreBidSeconds` defaults to `9`; still no real countdown loop exists.
- `AuctionConfig.BidResetSeconds` defaults to `3`; valid bids now copy this value into `AuctionState.CountdownDurationSeconds`, but no actual time passes.
- `AuctionConfig.MinimumBidIncrement` defaults to `1`; bid validation now uses it after the first bid.
- `AuctionConfig.StartingBid` defaults to `0`; first-bid validation now uses it.
- `AuctionStatus.ActiveBidCountdown` is metadata only; it does not trigger asynchronous behavior.
- `AuctionState.CountdownDurationSeconds` stores deterministic countdown duration metadata only.
- Placeholder board IDs/display names from Chunk 2.1 are preserved.
- Tile resolution action kinds remain placeholders and do not apply game effects.
- Property rent currently uses base rent only: the first rent table value, or a placeholder `10` for purchasable tiles without a rent table.
- Bankruptcy is hard elimination only; balances are not auto-corrected, no assets are liquidated, and no debt recovery is attempted.
- No protected Monopoly wording, branding, board names, card wording, artwork, or final token assumptions were introduced.

## Important Decisions Preserved

- Server-authoritative rules state.
- Unity remains untouched.
- Core game engine code lives under `server-dotnet/MonoJoey.Server/GameEngine`.
- Auctions still produce standalone `AuctionState`; `GameState` is not mutated and does not yet store active auction state.
- `AuctionManager.PlaceBid` returns a new `AuctionState` inside `AuctionBidResult`; rejected bids return the unchanged auction state.
- `AuctionManager.PlaceBid` requires a caller-supplied `DateTimeOffset` for bid history and does not read wall-clock time.
- Bid validation does not check bidder cash balance because payment and transfer are out of scope for this chunk.
- `AuctionManager.StartMandatoryAuction` treats `Tile.IsPurchasable && Tile.IsAuctionable` as auction eligibility.
- Disabled mandatory auctions return a typed no-auction result before player/tile lookup.
- Owned properties and non-auctionable tiles return typed no-auction results instead of throwing.
- Unknown triggering players and unknown tiles still throw `InvalidOperationException`, consistent with existing manager validation style.
- Unknown auction bidders return `AuctionBidResultKind.BidderNotInGame` instead of throwing, per Chunk 3.2 rejection scope.
- Ownership continues to live on `Player.OwnedPropertyIds`; no new persistence or aggregate ownership store was added.
- `PropertyManager.AssignOwner` remains the future ownership hook for auction resolution, but this chunk does not call it.
- Tile resolution remains neutral metadata only and does not mutate `GameState`.
- Dice are server-owned through a service and injectable roller abstraction.
- Movement is deterministic and consumes an already-known step count; it does not roll dice or apply landing effects.

## Next Recommended Chunk

Phase 3 follow-up - choose one narrow auction slice, only if explicitly requested.

Possible next scopes:

- Hook unowned property landing resolution into `AuctionManager.StartMandatoryAuction`.
- Add deterministic auction timeout/resolution result without payment/transfer.
- Add winner payment and property transfer after resolution exists.
- Add active-auction storage to `GameState`, if needed before integration.

Recommended validation:

- `dotnet build .\server-dotnet\MonoJoey.sln -m:1`
- `dotnet test .\server-dotnet\MonoJoey.sln -m:1`
- `git status --short --branch`

## Do Not Touch Notes

Do not implement before its assigned chunk:

- Real wall-clock timers.
- Async countdown loop.
- Winner finalization.
- Property transfer/payment.
- Loan Shark.
- Debt recovery.
- Asset liquidation.
- Cards.
- Mortgages.
- Houses/upgrades.
- Trading.
- Taxes/fines money changes.
- Jail/lockup status behavior.
- Lobbies.
- WebSockets.
- Database persistence.
- Stats.
- Unity scenes, prefabs, assets, project settings, metadata, animations, or editor UI.

## Fresh-Session Recommendation

Yes. Chunk 3.2 is complete, and a fresh session should continue from this handover before starting the next rules-engine chunk.
