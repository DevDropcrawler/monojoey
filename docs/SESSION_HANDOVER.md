# MonoJoey Session Handover

This file must be updated at the end of every coding chunk.

## Current Status

- Phase: 4
- Chunk: 4.3 Card action resolution hooks
- Completion status: Chunk 4.3 complete; drawn card metadata can be resolved into neutral structured effects without executing them.
- Branch: `main` tracking `origin/main`; local has this chunk implemented and validated for commit.
- Previous commit: `9998c11` - `phase-4-2: add card draw state`
- Last commit after this chunk: `phase-4-3: add card resolution hooks`
- Date/time: 2026-04-27 10:10 +12:00

## Last Completed Chunk

Phase 4, Chunk 4.3 - Card action resolution hooks only.

Completed:

- Added `CardActionParameters` for passive card metadata such as target tile, step count, and amount.
- Extended `Card` to carry optional passive parameters.
- Added `CardResolutionActionKind` for neutral resolved card effects.
- Added `CardResolutionResult` with `PlayerId`, `CardId`, resolved action kind, and optional parameters.
- Added `CardResolver.ResolveCard(player, card)` to map a card to a structured result without reading or mutating `GameState`.
- Mapped movement, money, lockup, release-from-lockup, nearest-property-type, and repair-style card action kinds to neutral result kinds.
- Invalid, unspecified, undefined, or missing-required-parameter cards return `CardResolutionActionKind.InvalidCard` instead of throwing.
- Added focused tests for every current `CardActionKind`, parameter pass-through, invalid card handling, placeholder deck validity, and no `GameState` mutation.

Not included by explicit user scope:

- Card action execution.
- Movement from cards.
- Money changes from cards.
- Jail/lockup behavior from cards.
- Networking.
- Unity/UI.
- Persistence.
- Stats.

## Validation Commands Run

- `dotnet build .\server-dotnet\MonoJoey.sln -m:1`
  - Result: succeeded.
  - Output summary: build succeeded, 2 warnings, 0 errors.
  - Warnings: `NU1900` vulnerability-data lookup could not reach `https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json`.
- `dotnet test .\server-dotnet\MonoJoey.sln -m:1`
  - Result: succeeded.
  - Output summary: 127 tests passed.
  - Warnings: same `NU1900` vulnerability-data lookup warning.
- `git status --short --branch`
  - Result before commit: `main...origin/main` with card resolution files, resolver tests, card metadata updates, and this handover doc.

## Known Issues

- Plain `dotnet build .\server-dotnet\MonoJoey.sln` and plain `dotnet test .\server-dotnet\MonoJoey.sln` can fail in this Windows shell with no MSBuild errors once the server project participates in the solution graph.
- Serialized validation with `-m:1` succeeds and should be used unless the build harness is revisited.
- `NU1900` warnings remain because NuGet vulnerability metadata lookup cannot reach `https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json`.
- `AGENTS.md` and `LEAN-CTX.md` were not present at the repo root in this sandbox view, though instructions referenced them.

## Placeholders Introduced Or Preserved

- `AuctionConfig.InitialPreBidSeconds` defaults to `9`; still no real countdown loop exists.
- `AuctionConfig.BidResetSeconds` defaults to `3`; valid bids now copy this value into `AuctionState.CountdownDurationSeconds`, but no actual time passes.
- `AuctionConfig.MinimumBidIncrement` defaults to `1`; bid validation now uses it after the first bid.
- `AuctionConfig.StartingBid` defaults to `0`; first-bid validation now uses it.
- `AuctionStatus.ActiveBidCountdown` is metadata only; it does not trigger asynchronous behavior.
- `AuctionState.CountdownDurationSeconds` stores deterministic countdown duration metadata only.
- Placeholder board IDs/display names from Chunk 2.1 are preserved.
- Tile resolution action kinds remain placeholders and do not apply game effects.
- Placeholder card IDs/display names from Chunk 4.1 are functional identifiers only, not final card names or text.
- Placeholder card decks have fixed ordered definitions; `CardDeckState.FromDeck()` preserves that order for deterministic draw behavior.
- Placeholder card action parameters are functional metadata only; tile targets and money amounts are not final card design.
- Empty card draw piles return `CardDrawResultKind.DrawPileEmpty`; discards are not reshuffled yet.
- Card deck state is standalone and is not stored in `GameState` yet.
- `CardResolutionActionKind.InvalidCard` is a safe resolver output for invalid or incomplete card definitions; it does not mutate state or discard cards.
- Property rent currently uses base rent only: the first rent table value, or a placeholder `10` for purchasable tiles without a rent table.
- Bankruptcy is hard elimination only; balances are not auto-corrected, no assets are liquidated, and no debt recovery is attempted.
- Loan interest is deducted only at turn start through `LoanManager.StartTurnInterestCheck`; it is not compounded, repaid, or otherwise collected.
- Loan interest after the third borrow increases by 10 percentage points per loan tier and caps at 100%.
- No protected Monopoly wording, branding, board names, card wording, artwork, or final token assumptions were introduced.

## Important Decisions Preserved

- Server-authoritative rules state.
- Unity remains untouched.
- Core game engine code lives under `server-dotnet/MonoJoey.Server/GameEngine`.
- Auctions still produce standalone `AuctionState`; `GameState` is not mutated and does not yet store active auction state.
- `AuctionManager.PlaceBid` returns a new `AuctionState` inside `AuctionBidResult`; rejected bids return the unchanged auction state.
- `AuctionManager.PlaceBid` requires a caller-supplied `DateTimeOffset` for bid history and does not read wall-clock time.
- Bid validation still does not check bidder cash balance; finalization handles payment failure deterministically.
- `AuctionManager.FinalizeAuction` assumes the auction has already ended; it does not read wall-clock time or advance timers.
- Auction finalization selects the highest non-eliminated bidder from bid history.
- Affordable auction winners pay the winning bid and receive ownership through `PropertyManager.AssignOwner`.
- Unaffordable auction winners are eliminated through `BankruptcyManager.EliminateForFailedPayment`; no money is deducted and the property remains unowned.
- `AuctionManager.StartMandatoryAuction` treats `Tile.IsPurchasable && Tile.IsAuctionable` as auction eligibility.
- Disabled mandatory auctions return a typed no-auction result before player/tile lookup.
- Owned properties and non-auctionable tiles return typed no-auction results instead of throwing.
- Unknown triggering players and unknown tiles still throw `InvalidOperationException`, consistent with existing manager validation style.
- Unknown auction bidders return `AuctionBidResultKind.BidderNotInGame` instead of throwing, per Chunk 3.2 rejection scope.
- Ownership continues to live on `Player.OwnedPropertyIds`; no new persistence or aggregate ownership store was added.
- `PropertyManager.AssignOwner` is now used for successful auction ownership transfer.
- Tile resolution remains neutral metadata only and does not mutate `GameState`.
- Dice are server-owned through a service and injectable roller abstraction.
- Movement is deterministic and consumes an already-known step count; it does not roll dice or apply landing effects.
- Loan state lives on `Player.LoanState` and is optional until a player first borrows.
- `LoanManager.TakeLoan` requires an explicit `BorrowPurpose` and mutates only the borrowing player's money and loan state through a returned `GameState` when the purpose is allowed.
- Loan rejection results return the unchanged `GameState`.
- Borrowing to pay `LoanInterest`, `LoanPrincipalRepayment`, or `ExistingLoanDebt` is rejected through `LoanTakeResultKind.DisallowedBorrowPurpose`.
- Borrowing remains allowed for `AuctionBid`, `RentPayment`, `TaxPayment`, `CardPenalty`, and `Fine`.
- `NextTurnInterestDue` is calculated from total borrowed and the stored current interest rate using integer money arithmetic.
- Start-of-turn loan interest also uses total borrowed and the stored current interest rate using the same integer money arithmetic.
- `TurnManager.StartFirstTurn` and `TurnManager.AdvanceToNextTurn` call `LoanManager.StartTurnInterestCheck` before the returned `AwaitingRoll` turn can produce a current player for roll handling.
- Unpaid start-turn interest is a forced deduction; if the resulting balance is negative, existing negative-balance bankruptcy elimination marks the player bankrupt/eliminated.
- Loan enforcement does not interact with auctions, repayment, networking, UI, persistence, or stats.
- Card definitions are passive metadata only: `Card`, `CardDeck`, `CardActionKind`, and `PlaceholderCardDeckFactory` do not mutate `GameState`.
- `CardActionParameters` are passive metadata only and do not execute movement, money changes, lockup changes, or held-card behavior.
- Chance-style and Table-style placeholder decks each contain 16 cards, matching standard property-board-game deck size expectations without copying protected wording.
- `CardActionKind.HoldForLater` marks retainable card functions only; it does not grant, revoke, or consume any held card behavior.
- `CardDeckManager.Draw()` and `CardDeckManager.Discard()` return new deck state instances and do not mutate previous deck state.
- Drawing from an empty draw pile returns the unchanged `CardDeckState`; no automatic reshuffle or randomization is implemented.
- Draw and discard logic affects only `CardDeckState`; it does not execute card actions, move players, change money, or alter lockup state.
- `CardResolver.ResolveCard(player, card)` maps `CardActionKind` plus card parameters into `CardResolutionResult` only.
- `CardResolver.ResolveCard(player, card)` does not accept `GameState`, does not mutate player state, and does not execute the resolved effect.
- Missing required parameters for parameterized card actions resolve as `InvalidCard` instead of throwing.

## Next Recommended Chunk

Phase 4 follow-up - choose one narrow card integration slice only if explicitly requested.

Possible next scopes:

- Add deterministic deck state to `GameState`.
- Add tile-to-deck draw integration without action execution.
- Add card action execution only as a separately scoped chunk after the execution rules are explicitly requested.

Recommended validation:

- `dotnet build .\server-dotnet\MonoJoey.sln -m:1`
- `dotnet test .\server-dotnet\MonoJoey.sln -m:1`
- `git status --short --branch`

## Do Not Touch Notes

Do not implement before its assigned chunk:

- Real wall-clock timers.
- Async countdown loop.
- Borrowing to cover auctions beyond the explicit `BorrowPurpose.AuctionBid` context marker.
- Loan repayment.
- Auction retry logic.
- Debt recovery.
- Asset liquidation.
- Automatic card reshuffling.
- Card action execution.
- Movement from cards.
- Money changes from cards.
- Jail/lockup behavior from cards.
- Mortgages.
- Houses/upgrades.
- Trading.
- Taxes/fines money changes.
- Jail/lockup status behavior.
- Lobbies.
- WebSockets.
- Database persistence.
- Stats.
- Unity scenes, prefabs, assets, project settings, metadata, animations, or editor UI.

## Fresh-Session Recommendation

Yes. Chunk 4.2 is complete, and a fresh session should continue from this handover before starting the next rules-engine chunk.
